                   <p style="text-align:justify;"> The year 2020 witnessed the arrival of COVID-19 and decline in education for underprivileged kids. While my own classes remained unaffected, I noticed that underprivileged children in government schools were facing a complete halt in their education. Within a 2 km radius of my home, around 25% of the population were facing the same problem, and they were unable to continue their studies due to technological barriers. Even as the pandemic subsided,  I conducted surveys that revealed that their classes had still not resumed.
                   In collaboration with Matrabhumi NGO, we took action. We rented five computers and provided them, along with Wi-Fi routers, to community halls in the slums. Recognizing that many teachers were not accustomed to online teaching, my team and I created online lecture materials to assist them and videos to guide them with necessary digital skills to navigate the internet, use software, or troubleshoot technical issues effectively. We organized students into batches and started delivering science and math lessons through these computers.
                    Our small initiative yielded significant results as the children successfully passed their exams. This was the turning point that led to the beginning of Uthaan’s journey.
                   During the launch of my book, “Amidst The Downpour”  I made a commitment that the royalty earnings from my book would be dedicated to Uthaan's initiatives. Working alongside my dedicated team, we raised awareness, offered support, and experienced the profound satisfaction of bringing about smiles to the faces that needed it the most.
                   With Uthaan and the team I had gathered, raising a voice for awareness, holding hands promising assurance, and that everlasting satisfaction to finally bring the change I always expected to be brought, felt like a victory.
